### Hi there 👋

### This is Isabelle! 
#### Data Scientist with a focus in MLOps

I am a former Research Scientist turned Data Scientist, now specializing in building robust, maintainable Machine Learning systems. My focus is on moving beyond "working code" toward mature engineering, prioritizing system integrity and architectural stability.

### **2026 Project:** The Quiet Build 

I am starting a journey to build AI products while learning how to architect robust and sustainable systems. I will document my thought process and how I use foundational references to build each block along the way, including design decisions  My first project in the Quiet Build will be to build an AI powered app my family’s heritage records. 

**Objective:** Developing a sustainable platform to preserve, digitize, and interact with archival family data.

**Engineering Focus:** Quality over speed, architectural robustness, and well-documented decision-making.

**Methodology:** Every technical choice is recorded as an ADR (Architecture Decision Record) to ensure traceability and intentionality.

**Lab Notebook:** Documentation and architectural logs are hosted here: [The Quiet Build](https://thecochenille.github.io/)


### **Technical Evolution**
- **2026:** Architecting "The Quiet Build" (Focus on MLOps & System Design).
- **2024:** MLOps Zoomcamp + Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree + AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification.

Background: 10+ years as a Research Scientist and Computational Biologist, bringing a rigorous experimental mindset to software engineering.


### ML Projects: 
- [Predict Customer Churn on a Subscription Music Platform](https://github.com/thecochenille/scaling-fishstick) - Supervised Machine Learning Classification models on AWS EMR and deployment on Streamlit ([online here](https://sparkify-churn-prediction.streamlit.app/))
- [Disaster Response Machine Learning Model based on Appen dataset](https://github.com/thecochenille/ML_AppenDisaster) - Multi-class classification model, Natural Language Processing, and a Flask App that you can run on your computer.

### Data Analytics Projects: 
- My analysis of the 2022 Stack Overflow Developer Survey to [draw how a data science role looks like](https://medium.com/@isabelle.vea/draw-me-a-data-scientist-ff970301df04)
