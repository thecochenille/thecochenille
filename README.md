### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### This is Isabelle! 

I am a data-driven scientist interested in Machine Learning and passionate about learning new tools and coding in Python. 
I would love to use my 9+ years of experience as a research scientist to drive actionable insights to business problems using data science. If you are interested in working with me on a project, feel free to connect on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/isabellevea/)

ðŸŒ± I am currently upskilling on Machine Learning at Udacity.

### Latest and in-progress projects (October 2023)
- [Women in Data 2023 Datathon project](https://github.com/TalkDatatoMeWiDDatathon23/ForestService-Census-Index)

### ML projects: 
- [Disaster Response Machine Learning Model based on Appen dataset](https://github.com/thecochenille/ML_AppenDisaster) - Flask App that you can run on your computer


I have [a blog on Medium](https://medium.com/@isabelle.vea) where you can read about:
- [How long it took me to learn how to walk again](https://medium.com/@isabelle.vea/looking-at-recovery-from-my-lisfranc-foot-fracture-using-data-viz-and-moving-averages-37a71a192bd1) (using data viz and Python)
- my analysis of the 2022 Stack Overflow Developer Survey to [draw how a data science role looks like](https://medium.com/@isabelle.vea/draw-me-a-data-scientist-ff970301df04)
- How I am navigating [pivoting into data science](https://medium.com/@isabelle.vea/transitioning-to-industry-pivoting-into-data-science-or-simply-finding-my-next-career-stage-9cb4d0bd6ec5)!

:books: I also write mini-tutorials on handling data throughout my learning journey with Python and coding more efficiently. Check my [Medium page](https://medium.com/@isabelle.vea)

I am also sharing my journey pivoting into data science and leaving academia on Linkedin [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/isabellevea/)
