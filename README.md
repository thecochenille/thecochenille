### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### This is Isabelle! 

I am a scientist passionate about data, learning new tools, and coding in Python & R. 

As a research scientist and computational biologist who has worked with various data types over the years, I would love to leverage machine learning and data application development to drive actionable insights into business problems. 

If you are interested in working with me on a project, message me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/isabellevea/)
