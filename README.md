### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is Isabelle! I am a research scientist pivoting into Data Science and more specifically Machine Learning.

You will find here notebooks of research and data science projects I am working on. 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently taking a nanodegree on Machine Learning at Udacity. Come back soon for more projects!

I have started [my blog on Medium](https://medium.com/@isabelle.vea) and you can read about:
